# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation
RAG Chatbot is a comprehensive document intelligence platform that transforms static files into interactive knowledge bases through advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

This full-stack application enables natural language question-answering across PDF, DOCX, and PPTX documents by combining semantic search (FAISS vector embeddings) with keyword matching (BM25) to intelligently retrieve relevant content and synthesize comprehensive answers using local LLMs via Ollama.

Featuring a modern React frontend with persistent chat sessions, source citations, and markdown-formatted responses including comparison tables, the system offers enterprise-grade document analysis capabilities while maintaining complete data privacy through local deployment.
